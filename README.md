# VMware Tanzu Data Services

## Greenplum
VMware Tanzu Greenplum is based on PostgreSQL and the Greenplum Database project. It offers optional use-case specific extensions like PostGIS for geospatial analysis, and GPText (based on Apache Tika and Apache Solr) for document extraction, search, and natural language processing. These are pre-integrated to ensure a consistent experience, not a “wild-west,” DIY open source approach. Instead of depending on expensive proprietary databases, users can benefit from the contributions of a vibrant community of developers.


## Gemfire
VMware Tanzu GemFire is a distributed, in-memory, key-value store that performs read and write operations at blazingly fast speeds. It offers highly available parallel message queues, continuous availability, and an event-driven architecture you can scale dynamically, with no downtime. As your data size requirements increase to support high-performance, real-time apps, Tanzu GemFire can scale linearly with ease.
