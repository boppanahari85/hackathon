# VMware Tanzu Data Services

### Greenplum
VMware Tanzu Greenplum is based on PostgreSQL and the Greenplum Database project. It offers optional use-case specific extensions like PostGIS for geospatial analysis, and GPText (based on Apache Tika and Apache Solr) for document extraction, search, and natural language processing. These are pre-integrated to ensure a consistent experience, not a “wild-west,” DIY open source approach. Instead of depending on expensive proprietary databases, users can benefit from the contributions of a vibrant community of developers.
